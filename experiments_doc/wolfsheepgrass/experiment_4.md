# EXPERIMENT 4

## WHAT I TRIED
For this experiment i tried another way to modelize the interaction beetween sheeps and wolfs. 
This is not really necessary for this simulation. In this simulation is not necessary that a wolf specifically eat a specifically sheep. In other simulation where is important that, we must gave the possibility to do very rapidly this.

## TRIVIAL IMPLEMENTATION
In the case of this simulation, the implementation that i have tried in the experiment_3

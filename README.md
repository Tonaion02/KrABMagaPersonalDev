<center> <h1> MY PERSONAL KRABMAGA DEVELOPMENT REPOSITORY </h1> </center>

The following is my personal repository for development of [KrABMaga](https://krabmaga.github.io/) during my apprenticeship.

My work is focused above trying to squeeze performance of the framework using the [ECS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system#:~:text=Entity%E2%80%93component%E2%80%93system) of [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org/). 

## EXPLORE MY EXPERIMENTS

Each experiment is contained in a different directory in [examples](https://github.com/Tonaion02/KrABMagaTirocinio_provisory/tree/fix_simulations/examples).

At the moment i have tried to improve performance of the framework working to these simulations:
- Flockers
- WolfSheepGrass

To understand what i have tried check documentation of each experiment [here](https://github.com/Tonaion02/KrABMagaTirocinio_provisory/tree/fix_simulations/experiments_doc).

# MY PERSONAL KRABMAGA DEVELOPMENT REPOSITORY

The following is my personal repository for development of [KrABMaga](https://krabmaga.github.io/) during my apprenticeship.

My work is focused above trying to squeeze performance of the framework using the [ECS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system#:~:text=Entity%E2%80%93component%E2%80%93system) of [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org/). 

To understand what i have tried check documentation of each experiment [here](https://github.com/Tonaion02/KrABMagaTirocinio_provisory/tree/fix_simulations/experiments_doc).
